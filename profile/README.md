### Welcome to Subsurface Studios!
We're a small group of indie game developers coming together to work on free projects for everyone to enjoy.  
  
## Main project:

### Compensation VR
Compensation VR is a VR social multiplayer game, in the vein of Rec Room, VR Chat, Neos VR, and others.  
Built from the ground up with the primary goal of letting people meet friends, old and new, why not give it a try?
