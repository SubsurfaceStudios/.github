### Compensation Social
Compensation Social was a VR social multiplayer game, in the vein of Rec Room, VRChat, Neos VR, and others.  
Built from the ground up with the primary goal of letting people meet friends, old and new, why not give it a try?  
Do note, this project is no longer recieving updates. The only way to play is using dedicated servers, hosted by our
community.
